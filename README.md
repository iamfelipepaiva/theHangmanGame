# THE HANGMAN

College discipline final project developed mostly individually as a personal challenge.

This game aims at offering another digital entertainment option to people with some level alphabetization through two possible modalities: Individual or in pair.

In individual playing mode, the player is challenged to complete a random word, within the 4 possible predefined categories of words to the game (Car Makers, Countries, Capitals and Devices). In the pair mode, one of the players inputs a tip and word related to it of their choice to challenge their friend to successfully complete within the limited number of wrong-letter tries. The code can be customized.
